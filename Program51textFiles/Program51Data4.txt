The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light
Whoever is happy will make others happy too
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
You will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated
In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all
