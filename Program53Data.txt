Amidst the world’s trash is sometimes where you will find God’s Treasure
Knowledge is a unique Treasure which no one can acquire easily
Where the world hides wisdom the universe places its Treasure
True wisdom is like an ocean the deeper you the greater the Treasure you'll find

If gold was as plentiful as sand, it would not be as valuable as Treasure
Riches you hold in your hands are inferior to Treasure you store in your heart
Riches you hold in your hands are inferior to Treasure you harbor in your heart
Wealth is a small blessing, health is a great asset, happiness is an extraordinary Treasure and life is a remarkable reward
When you Treasure what you have, you are already rich
Bengalure is in South India
